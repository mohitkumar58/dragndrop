1. This is a drag and drop exercise.
2. This is in jQuery.
3. There are draggable elements in the left and droppable options in the right. Below you will find 3 input boxes with some numbers.
4. This is a multi drop exercise in which multiple elements can be dropped inside any drop zone. Drag items can revert but cannot be dropped anywhere but only the dropzone.
5. Each drop zone will be associated with an input box.
6. Each drag items will have some unique id.
7. Now, for example if the first dropzone has 2 drag elements inside it with id 1 & 2 respectively then the first input box will have output 1,2. If second dropzone has a drag element with id 3 the the second dropzone will have 3 inside it.
